# Some-Softuni-Exercises
I lost all my work for the last two- three years of programming. Luckily i could download some of my Submissions from Judge system of SoftUni

How to read the exercises:

There would be separated foulders, each folder containing project + docx document that has description of all exercises for this project.

NOTE:
The solution of each exercise might be written in the same StartUp.cspoj, but in separated methods
