# Some-Softuni-Exercises
I lost all my work for the last two- three years of programming. Luckily i could download some of my Submissions from Judge system of SoftUni



How to read the exercises:

*The solutions are separated in different folders, each folder contains project + docx document that has in it description of all exercises given for this project.

NOTE:
The solution of each exercise might be written in the same StartUp.cspoj, but in separated methods
