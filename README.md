# Some-Softuni-Exercises
I lost all my work for the last two- three years of programming. Luckily i was able to find very small bit of the exercises I've done in studying in Softuni. 

How to read the exercises:

*The solutions are separated in different folders. Each folder contains project + docx document that has description of the exercises .

NOTE:
The solution of each exercise might be written in the same StartUp.cspoj, but in separated methods
